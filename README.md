This is still in active development and is probably very broken and may crash a lot so be warned

This mod requires Lovely and Steamodded to function.

# Horizon

A shitty balatro mod made by a bunch of nerds

Is it balanced? Probably poorly.

Is it fun? We say so.

How do I download it?

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/FunctionalNyx/Horizon/releases) for a probably not game breakingly broken experience.
Otherwise just download the code directly for the most "up-to-date" version thats probably VEEERY broken (Proceed at your own risk)

Have fun
